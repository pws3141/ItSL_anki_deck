  \field\ Best Subset Selection
  \field\ 
        To perform best subset selection, we fit \cloze{1}a seperate least squares
        regression for each possible combination of the $p$ predictors\clend{}.

        The procedure is (where $\mathcal{M}_0$ is the null model with no predictors):
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item For $j = 1, \ldots, p$:
                \cloze{2}
                \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Fit all ${p \choose k}$ models that contain exactly
                                $k$ predictors;
                        \item Pick the ``best'' model, $\mathcal{M}_k$, such that
                                \textit{e.g.}\ RSS is minimised, or $R^2$ maximised.
                \end{enumerate}
                \clend{}
        \item \cloze{2}Select the single best model from $\mathcal{M}_0, \ldots,
                \mathcal{M}_p$,
                using \textit{e.g.}\ the prediction error on a validation set,
                        adjusted $R^2$, or cross validation.\clend{}

  \field\ Best Subset Selection
        \field\ Best subset selection suffers from \cloze{1}computational
        limitations\clend{}. In general, there are \cloze{1}$2^p$ models that
        involve subsets of $p$ predictors\clend{}.

  \field\ Forward Stepwise Selection
        \field\ Forward stepwise selection begins with \cloze{1}a model containing
        no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model, one-at-a-time, until
        all of the predictors are in the model\clend{}. At each step \cloze{1}the
        variable that gives the greatest additional improvement to the fit is added
        to the model\clend{}.

  \field\ Forward Stepwise Selection
        \field\ Forward stepwise selection can be applied even in the scenario
        \cloze{1}$n < p$,
        although here only the first $n$ stepwise models, $\mathcal{M}_0, \ldots,
        \mathcal{M}_{n - 1}$, can be found\clend{}. Beyond this, \cloze{1}least
        squares does not give a unique solution\clend{}.

  \field\ Adjusting the training error
  \field\ Four approaches to selecting among a set of models with different number
        of variables are: \cloze{1}$C_p$, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian
        information criterion (BIC), and adjusted $R^2$\clend{}.

  \field\ $C_p$ estimate of test MSE
  \field\ For a fitted least squares model containing $d$ predictors, the $C_p$
        estimate of test MSE is given by,
        \cloze{1}
        \[
        C_p = \frac{1}{n} (RSS + 2d \hat{\sigma}^2),
        \]
        \clend{}
        where \cloze{1}$\hat{\sigma}^2$ is an estimate of the variance of the error
        $\varepsilon$ associated with each response measurement\clend{}.
        Typically, \cloze{2}$\hat{\sigma}^2$ is estimated using the full model
        containing all predictors\clend{}.

  \field\ $C_p$ estimate of test MSE
        \field\ Essentially, the $C_p$ statistic \cloze{1}adds a penalty of
        $2d\hat{\sigma}^2$ to the training RSS in order to adjust for the fact that
        the training error tends to underestimate the test error\clend{}.

  \field\ Akaike Information Criterion
\field\ For a standard multiple regression model, least squares and
        maximum likelihood are the same. In this case AIC is given by
        \cloze{1}
        \[
        \text{AIC} \propto \frac{1}{n} (RSS + 2d \hat{\sigma}^2).
        \]
        \clend\
        Hence, \cloze{1} for least squares models, $C_p$ and AIC are proportional to
        each other\clend{}.

  \field\ Adjusted-$R^2$
  \field\ For a least squares model with $d$ predictors, the adjusted $R^2$
        statistic is given by
        \cloze{1}
        \[
                \text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS} / (n - d- 1)}{\text{TSS}
                / (n - 1)}.
        \]
        \clend\
        A \cloze{2} large value \clend\ of adjusted $R^2$ indicates a model with
        \cloze{2} small test error \clend{}.

\begin{note}{itsl-612}
  \field\ Adjusted-$R^2$
  \field\ The intuition behind the adjusted $R^2$ is that once all of the correct
        variables have been included in the model, adding \cloze{1}additional noise
        variables will lead to only a very small decrease in RSS\clend{}.  Since
        adding \cloze{1}noise variables leads to an increase in $d$, such variables
        will lead to an increase in $RSS/(n - d - 1)$, and consequently a decrease
        in the adjusted $R^2$\clend{}.

  \field\ Validation and cross-validation
  \field\ Using validation and cross-validation procedures to estimate test error
        has an advantage relative to AIC, BIC, $C_p$, and adjusted $R^2$, in that
        \cloze{1}it provides a direct estimate of the test error, and makes fewer
        assumptions about the true underlying model\clend{}.
        It can also be used in a wider range of model selection tasks, even in cases
        where \cloze{2}it is hard to pinpoint the model degrees of freedom (\textit{e.g.}\
        the number of predictors in the model) or hard to estimate the error
        variance $\sigma^2$\clend{}.

  \field\ The one-standard-error rule
  \field\ When choosing between models with different degrees of freedoms, the
        one-standard-error rule can be applied, where the \cloze{1} simplest model
        out of ``equally good'' models is chosen\clend{}.
        We first calculate \cloze{2}the one-standard error of the estimated test MSE for
        each model size, and then select the smallest model for which the estimated
        test error is within one standard error of the lowest point on the
        curve\clend{}.

  \field\ Ridge Regression
  \field\ In linear models, ridge regression coefficients $\beta^R$ are chosen to
        minimise,
        \cloze{1}
        \[
                \text{RSS} + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^p \beta_j^2
                    = \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - 
                        \sum_{j = 1}^p \beta_j x_{ij})^2
                        + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^p \beta_j^2,
                \]\clend{}
        where \cloze{1}$\lambda \geq 0$ is some tuning parameter\clend{}.
