# Anki Deck for Introduction to Statistical Learning

Anki notes to help with learning an [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/).

First set of notes written directly into Anki (Ch 1 - 3, 7, 8, 9). All later notes written using the great [latex2anki](https://github.com/TentativeConvert/LaTeX2Anki) program.

At some point I will go back over the original notes such that they are all in MathCloze format.
